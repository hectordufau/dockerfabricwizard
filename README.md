# Docker Fabric Wizard

Welcome to Docker Fabric Wizard, a tool designed to simplify the automated installation of [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/hyperledger/) containers. This tool is aimed at professionals and students interested in blockchain technology.

> __Warning__
This project is under development, so it is not ready for use yet. It is also not an official [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) tool.

## Overview

Docker Fabric Wizard streamlines the process of setting up a [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) network by utilizing [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/hyperledger/) containers. It offers an automated installation process based on user-provided network structure details. The tool generates and configures the necessary [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/hyperledger/) containers, allowing you to quickly deploy a [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) network for development, testing, or educational purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Linux OS
- Docker
- Python (version 3.10 minimal).
- Basic understanding of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Hyperledger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) concepts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hectordufau/dockerfabricwizard.git
   cd dockerfabricwizard
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary network structure details.

4. The Docker Fabric Wizard will generate and configure Docker containers based on your inputs.

5. Once the installation is complete, you will have a Hyperledger Fabric network up and running within Docker containers.

## Fixing docker permissions

1. Enable non-root user access

   ```
   sudo groupadd -f docker
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   newgrp docker
   sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
   sudo chown -R "$USER":"$USER" $HOME/.docker
   sudo chmod -R g+rw "$HOME/.docker"
   ```

2. Edit docker service file

   ```
   sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
   ```

3. Append the following lines to the bottom of the Service section:

   ```
   [Service]
   ...
   SupplementaryGroups=docker
   ExecStartPost=/bin/chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

   ```

4. Restart Docker Engine

   ```
   sudo service docker restart
   ```
